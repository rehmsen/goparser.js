jsgoparser
==========

A parser for the Go programming language written in JavaScript.

This code is still in very early stages and incomplete. Feel free to contact me if you interested. This is a weekend
project, so it remains to see how far I'll get.

The code is heavily inspired by the acorn JavaScript parser, though I chose to make some stuff more object oriented. 
We shall have to see if the performance cost for that is too high and I need to back up. 

Disclaimer: This is one of my first JavaScript projects, so any advice is very welcome :)
